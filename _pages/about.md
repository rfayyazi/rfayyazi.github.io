Hi! I'm a NeuroAI researcher at [Cold Spring Harbor Lab](https://www.cshl.edu/), where I work with [Ben Cowley](https://cowleygroup.cshl.edu/) and [Florin Albeanu](https://albeanulab.labsites.cshl.edu/) to build computational models of decision-making behavior in mice. I am broadly interested in modeling the cognitive algorithms underlying lifelong, autotelic decision-making in animals, and building similarily capable artificial agents. 
<!-- I am particularily interested in continual learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and intrinsic motivation. -->

In Fall 2025, I will be starting a PhD in the [Cognition and Perception](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/psychology/graduate/phd-cognition-perception.html) program at NYU. Before joining CSHL, I received an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Integrated Science from The University of British Columbia, working with [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/) and [Jeremy Seamans](https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/faculty/jeremy-seamans/).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
