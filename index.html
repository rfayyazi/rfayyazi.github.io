<h1>Ryan Fayyazi</h1>
<p>I'm in my fourth year of an honours B.Sc. at the Univeristy of British Columbia, studying computer science and neuroscience.</p>
  
<p>Current research:
    <li><a href="https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/seamans-jeremy">Jeremy Seamans Lab:</a> Characterizing activity in rat mPFC and BLA during multiarmed-bandit-style decision-making with non-stationary and uncertain reward probabilities.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Frank Wood Lab</a>: Using an ODE-based simulation of the C. elegans nervous system, I'm (1) infering hidden neural voltages from observed body-positions, and (2) automatically synthesizing synaptic learning rules underlying habituation.</li>
  </p>
  
<p>My long-term goal is to model the information processing underlying human planning, decision-making, and intuition.</p>
