<h1>Ryan Fayyazi</h1>
<p>I'm in my fourth year of an honours B.Sc. at the Univeristy of British Columbia, studying machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. 
  
  Current research:
  
    * With <a href="https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/seamans-jeremy">Dr. Jeremy Seamans</a>, I am characterizing the neural activity in the medial PFC and basolateral amygdala of rats during a multiarmed-bandit-style decision task, with non-stationary and uncertain reward probabilities.
    * With <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Dr. Frank Wood</a>.</p>, I am modeling neural processing in C. elegans through inference of hidden neuron voltages from observed body positions. For my honours thesis, I am developing a pipeline for synthesizing non-linear learning rules from pre- and postsynaptic calcium observations during habituation. 
  
  I want to understand the information processing underlying human planning, decision-making, and intuition.
