<h1>Ryan Fayyazi</h1>
<p>I'm a fourth year undergrad at the Univeristy of British Columbia, studying computer science and neuroscience.
  Currently, I'm researching the role of the prefrontal cortex in decision making with <a href="https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/seamans-jeremy">Jeremy Seamans</a>, 
  and statistical inference in C. elegans with <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Frank Wood</a>.</p>
<p>I want to understand the information processing underlying human planning, decision-making, and intuition.</p>
