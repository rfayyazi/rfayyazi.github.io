  <p>I am a graduate student in the Programming Languages for Artifial Intelligence (<a href="https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/">PLAI</a>) Lab at UBC, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Dr. Frank Wood</a>.
  I graduated from UBC with a B.Sc. in integrated science, combining neuroscience and computer science.</p>    -->
  
<!--   I'm in my fourth year of an honours B.Sc. at the Univeristy of British Columbia, studying computer science and neuroscience. 
  With <a href="https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca/seamans-jeremy">Dr. Jeremy Seamans</a>, I characterized rat mPFC/BLA activity during a non-stationary multi-armed bandit task. 
  With <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/">Dr. Frank Wood</a>, I am using a simulator of the C. elegans nervous system to build pipelines for 
  (1) inferring hidden neural voltages from observed body-positions, and (2) automatically synthesizing synaptic learning rules underlying habituation.</p>
