The objective of this work is to characterize the neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rats, during a non-stationary multi-armed bandit-style task. We performed simultaneous multi-unit extracellular recording in the mPFC and BLA.

- Responsible for refining the rats’ tasks to better isolate behaviours of interest, as well as training and electrophysiological data collection on these tasks. Along with Dr. Einarsson, I adjust amplitude and shape thresholds based on the spike waveforms we’re detecting that day.

- Responsible for various single-unit and neuron-ensemble data analyses. This includes: analyses of interspike intervals and of firing pattern likelihoods based on various priors, decision trees, and PCA/SVD. These analyses are complementary to but largely independent of those conducted by Dr. Einarsson, and are discussed directly with Dr. Seamans. I’m also responsible for data preprocessing, and have some practice with manual spike sorting. Finally, I’ve built rational models to simulate decision-making in our task (e.g. non-stationary multi-armed bandits), and compared the rats’ behaviour to theirs.

- Built a frame to stabilize the stage supporting the electrodes in the brain, removing an electrical artifact that had been heavily polluting our data (a very proud moment).

I produced a simple model for Dr. Nate J. Powell (postdoc), which compared the accuracy and precision of different sampling distributions in approximating an underlying logistical function. The results were used to evaluate the experimental design chosen in an earlier study.
